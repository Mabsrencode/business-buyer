            <p>
              You won't need a Mensa membership to negotiate with us. Selling
              your business doesn't need to be stressful or complicated

              Life is too short to spend it with undesirables. We make sure
              everyone in our ecosystem - from advisors to investors - share the
              same values as us. That includes being honest and doing what we
              promise, even when its inconvenient.

            <h3>Grow, but <br /> the right way</h3>
            <p>
              Nothing is less appealing to us than growing profits at the
              expense of the employees that generate them. We seek long-term
              sustainable growth over short-term sugar hits.

              Unlike other investors we are hands-on because you can't
              understand a business from and Ivory tower. We seek to collaborate
              with our management, not dictate from a distance.

            <h3>Standing on the <br /> shoulder of the giants</h3>
            <p>
              We invest in good businesses and recognize their success is a
              function of the years of hard work put in by those who came before
              us. So we take the time to intimately understand the business
              before changing anything.
